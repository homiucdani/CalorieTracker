why we put data, domain etc in this package, why we do the implementation in the core -> data
We use this information on the entire project, so the specific features that implement this core package knows
from where to load the data.
With the help of the screens we gather a bunch of data, when we arrive on the main screen where we track all the data
we can access this core package and the implementation.
